Create region, and room classes

Change MapLevel constructor to instead of just assigning characters to
a region, track what region it is in, and create a new object and 
populate that objects squares instead

Change torch function to instead on each character move make all squares
in players range visible, have a trigger on the mapspace class that has a
a flag "player entered room" or something, and if that flag is true, the torch
method is called for that entire room.

Research c# events and subscribers to track when a user enters a room 
i.e. steps on a doorway/steps on an interior floor that isn't visible.

Also refactor the astar method to use a GetSpace method, that accesses
the mapspace details for the given coords, since the region object
won't have those details.

In terms of tracking the layout of the level, since I won't be using
levelMap anymore, the something list containing the levels would now
need to contain a list of level objects, which contains a list of region
objects, which contains a room object.

The spaces surrounding player code can be completely removed following 
this too.

The initial torch method would now need to make the entire first region
visible instead of the spaces around the player.
